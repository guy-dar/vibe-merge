# Vibe Merge

**The Coder's AI-powered Copy-Paste! 🚀**

Vibe Merge is a developer tool that reimagines the way you copy and paste code in an AI-enhanced workflow. In an era where code is increasingly generated by AI, the old rules of "copy-paste" no longer cut it. You don’t just want to paste code — you want to *integrate* it.

Vibe Merge intelligently transforms and merges code snippets to fit seamlessly into your current context. Whether you're transplanting between languages, applying a function, or resolving semantic overlaps, Vibe Merge does the heavy lifting.

## ✨ Features

### 🔁 Transplant
Paste code into a new context, and let Vibe Merge adjust it to:
- Match the surrounding syntax
- Adopt the existing codebase's style and conventions
- Translate or adapt between programming languages or frameworks

### 🧠 Apply
Combine code snippets logically:
- Paste one snippet as an argument to another
- Adapt and bind variables or references as needed
- Build functions and logic flows from separate pieces of code

### 🧬 Semantic Merge
When working with overlapping or similar code blocks:
- Intelligently merge two or more code fragments like a Git merge, but with deeper semantic understanding
- Resolve conflicts and deduplicate logic
- Maintain functionality while preserving both structure and intent


## 🧩 Why Vibe Merge?

Traditional copy-paste tools are limited — they don’t understand code. Vibe Merge leverages AI to provide a **semantic, context-aware** way to copy and paste, making your workflow faster, smarter, and less error-prone.

- ✅ Save time editing pasted code
- ✅ Reduce bugs from mismatched contexts
- ✅ Let AI do the mechanical work so you can stay in flow
